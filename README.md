This project, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, aims to create an engaging Pokémon-themed experience.

## Objective
The primary goal is to allow users to select a Pokémon, give it a name, and have it appear within a virtual house. Future enhancements, including database integration, will enable the saving of Pokémon data. Users can nurture and train their Pokémon, engage them in battles with other wild Pokémon, earn in-game currency, and use it to decorate their virtual home.
